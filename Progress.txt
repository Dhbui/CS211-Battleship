Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a program where a user is able to play the game Battleship against a computer.

Overall Progress:
The necessary files have been created that represent an individual board and ships in the a game of Battleship.
This includes:
    1) A Board object that can
        A) Store available spaces for firing moves
        B) Store spaces that are occupied by ships
        C) Store all floating ships on the board
        D) Add ships
        E) Fire at spaces
    2) A Ship object that
        A) Holds information about what spaces are occupied by that ship
        B) Stores the length of the ship
    3) An Enum that represents the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical) of a ship

Current Work:
GUI for the user to play the game.
Computerized decision making.
    The computer's decisions for shots will be based on:
        1) Previous shots that have hit ships
            i) After hitting a shot, the computer will circle all orientations around the hit until it makes a second hit.
            ii) The computer will then follow the direction of the two shots until hit sinks the ship or hits water.
            iii) The computer will then continue in the opposite direction if the ship has not sunk yet.
        2) Utilizing the average length of remaining ships to randomly fire at spaces that have a straight connected length equal to or greater than the average.
Additionally, creating a difficulty setting for the computer's decision making which would decrease the quality and increase randomness of each shot is under consideration.
