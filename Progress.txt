Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a program where a user is able to play the game Battleship against a computer.

Overall Progress:
The necessary files have been created that represent an individual board and ships in the a game of Battleship.
This includes:
    1) A Board object that can
        A) Store available spaces for firing moves
        B) Store spaces that are occupied by ships
        C) Store all floating ships on the board
        D) Add ships to the board
        E) Fire at spaces
    2) A Ship object that
        A) Holds information about what spaces are occupied by that ship
        B) Stores the length of the ship (2, 3, 4, or 5)
        C) Stores the type of ship (e.g. "Patrol Boat", "Carrier", etc.)
    3) An Enum that represents the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical) of a ship
    4) Computerized Decision-Making
        A)  The computer's decisions for shots will be based on:
            1) Previous shots that have hit ships
                i) After hitting a shot, the index of the hit will be added to an array of shots that need to be cleared by the computer.
                ii) After hitting a shot, the computer will fire in an upwards direction from the hit until it misses or the ship sinks
                iii) Then it will travel downwards if the ship has not sunk yet or until it misses
                iv) Then it will travel left
                v) Then it will travel right
                vi) After a ship is sunk, all of the hit spaces pertaining to that ship are removed from the list of spaces to be cleared
                vii) Effectively, this will attempt to clear spaces around a hit until one ship, or multiple ships that are touching, have sunk
            2) A probability calculation based on how likely a space is occupied by a ship
                i) A connection is defined as a possible placement of a ship that would occupy a given space
                ii) The computer analyzes number of connections for each space based on the average length of ships remaining
                iii) The computer will fire at the space with most connections if there are no current hits to be cleared
        B) Placement of ships is completely randomized.
    5) A BattleshipGame object, which will handle the management of two Board objects, and run the game
        A) This object can handle both a single player game against a CPU and a local multiplayer game between two people

Current Work:
GUI for the user to play the game.
Additionally, creating a difficulty setting for the computer's decision making which would decrease the quality and increase randomness of each shot is under consideration.
